      <h4>What Is a Stock?</h4>
      <p>
        A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the
        ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the
        stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to
        how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." Stocks are
        bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges, though there can be
        private sales as well, and are the foundation of many individual
        investors' portfolios. These transactions have to conform to government
        regulations which are meant to protect investors from fraudulent
        practices. Historically, they have outperformed most other investments
        over the long run. These investments can be purchased from most online
        stock brokers. Stock investment differs greatly from real estate
        investment.

          A stock is a form of security that indicates the holder has
          proportionate ownership in the issuing corporation. Corporations issue
          (sell) stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. There are two
          main types of stock: common and preferred.

      <h3>Understanding Stocks</h3>
      <p>
        Corporations issue (sell) stock to raise funds to operate their
        businesses. The holder of stock (a shareholder) has now bought a piece
        of the corporation and, depending on the type of shares held, may have a
        claim to a part of its assets and earnings. In other words, a
        shareholder is now an owner of the issuing company. Ownership is
        determined by the number of shares a person owns relative to the number
        of outstanding shares. For example, if a company has 1,000 shares of
        stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares, that person would own
        and have claim to 10% of the company's assets and earnings.
        <br></br>
        Stock holders do not own corporations; they own shares issued by
        corporations. But corporations are a special type of organization
        because the law treats them as legal persons. In other words,
        corporations file taxes, can borrow, can own property, can be sued, etc.
        The idea that a corporation is a “person” means that the corporation
        owns its own assets. A corporate office full of chairs and tables
        belongs to the corporation, and not to the shareholders.
        <br></br>
        This distinction is important because corporate property is legally
        separated from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability
        of both the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes
        bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets sold – but your personal
        assets are not at risk. The court cannot even force you to sell your
        shares, although the value of your shares will have fallen drastically.
        Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, she cannot sell the
        company’s assets to pay off her creditors.
      </p>

      <h4>Stockholders and Equity Ownership</h4>
      <p>
        What shareholders actually own are shares issued by the corporation; and
        the corporation owns the assets held by a firm. So if you own 33% of the
        shares of a company, it is incorrect to assert that you own one-third of
        that company; it is instead correct to state that you own 100% of
        one-third of the company’s shares. Shareholders cannot do as they please
        with a corporation or its assets. A shareholder can’t walk out with a
        chair because the corporation owns that chair, not the shareholder. This
        is known as the “separation of ownership and control.”
        <br></br>
        Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings,
        receive dividends (which are the company’s profits) if and when they are
        distributed, and it gives you the right to sell your shares to somebody
        else. If you own a majority of shares, your voting power increases so
        that you can indirectly control the direction of a company by appointing
        its board of directors.5﻿ This becomes most apparent when one company
        buys another: the acquiring company doesn’t go around buying up the
        building, the chairs, the employees; it buys up all the shares. The
        board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the
        corporation, and often does so by hiring professional managers, or
        officers, such as the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO. For most ordinary
        shareholders, not being able to manage the company isn't such a big
        deal. The importance of being a shareholder is that you are entitled to
        a portion of the company's profits, which, as we will see, is the
        foundation of a stock’s value. The more shares you own, the larger the
        portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, however, do not pay out
        dividends, and instead reinvest profits back into growing the company.
        These retained earnings, however, are still reflected in the value of a
        stock.
      </p>
      <h4>Common vs. Preferred Stock</h4>
      <p>
        There are two main types of stock: common and preferred. Common stock
        usually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders' meetings and to
        receive any dividends paid out by the corporation. Preferred
        stockholders generally do not have voting rights, though they have a
        higher claim on assets and earnings than the common stockholders. For
        example, owners of preferred stock (such as Larry Page) receive
        dividends before common shareholders and have priority in the event that
        a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated.2﻿
        <br></br>
        The first common stock ever issued was by the Dutch East India Company
        in 1602.6﻿
        <br></br>
        Companies can issue new shares whenever there is a need to raise
        additional cash. This process dilutes the ownership and rights of
        existing shareholders (provided they do not buy any of the new
        offerings). Corporations can also engage in stock buy-backs which would
        benefit existing shareholders as it would cause their shares to
        appreciate in value.
      </p>
      <h4>Stocks vs. Bonds</h4>
      <p>
        Stocks are issued by companies to raise capital, paid-up or share, in
        order to grow the business or undertake new projects. There are
        important distinctions between whether somebody buys shares directly
        from the company when it issues them (in the primary market) or from
        another shareholder (on the secondary market). When the corporation
        issues shares, it does so in return for money.
        <br></br>ß
        Bonds are fundamentally different from stocks in a number of ways.
        First, bondholders are creditors to the corporation, and are entitled to
        interest as well as repayment of principal. Creditors are given legal
        priority over other stakeholders in the event of a bankruptcy and will
        be made whole first if a company is forced to sell assets in order to
        repay them. Shareholders, on the other hand, are last in line and often
        receive nothing, or mere pennies on the dollar, in the event of
        bankruptcy. This implies that stocks are inherently riskier investments
        that bonds
